# Multi-Cancer-Identification-and-Segmentation-Using-Brain-and-Breast-Scans
# Project Aims:
-Apply image classification to classify each image as a brain scan or a breast scan and then determine if the scan is normal or if it has a tumor.

-Apply image segmentation to determine the exact location of the infected area.

-Determine the width and height of the tumor in the scan if it exists.
